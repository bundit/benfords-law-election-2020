# Benford's Law

[Benford's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law) is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data.

It has been shown that this result applies to a wide variety of data sets, including electricity bills, street addresses, stock prices, house prices, population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, and physical and mathematical constants. It tends to be most accurate when values are distributed across multiple orders of magnitude, especially if the process generating the numbers is described by a power law (which is common in nature).

## Benford's Law and the US 2020 Election

There have been [multiple graphs](https://github.com/cjph8914/2020_benfords) circulating online that questions the authenticity of the results of the election. However, these graphs only show data in some states.

## What is this website?

This website aims to display both candidates' results graphed side by side against Benford's Law in an easily digestible form.

## What is the data being graphed?

The method is simple. Take the number of votes that a candidate received in each county and count its leading digit. Graph the total number of occurance of each leading digit (1-9) and the expected Benford's values.
